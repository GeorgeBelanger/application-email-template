    - Had an issue where some of my css wasn't making it to email template in gmail
      @ Used premailer found here https://github.com/peterbe/premailer/
      | Had an issue where I named my premailer-converter file premailer and had `from premailer import transform`
        @ Changed name to premail.py
    - Got the icons from my resume as files, but now need them to become urls
      - Did it by uploading them to a public google images folder, the urls are long unfortunately.
